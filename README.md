# Better-Explosive-Ammo
A small mod that makes explosive arrows a bit more useful and explosive slugs a LOT more useful.

  In the current experimental version (as of August 26, 2022), explosive slugs are crap, bordering on useless. This mod changes that.
  
  The explosive slug is actually due to be obsoleted within a couple of days (as of August 27, 2022), so this mod fixes that as well.
  
  Vanilla explosive slugs deal about 10 damage on impact, followed by an extremely underwhelming explosive breeze effect that deals very little damage. They also cannot penetrate doors.
  
  The new explosive slug will penetrate some objects and deal substantial damage to wooden obstructions. They deal slightly less damage on-hit compared to a regular shotgun slug, but they also create a small fragmentation explosion on the target tile that deals massively traumatic damage to anything there and substantial damage to adjacent entities. I'm actually not sure what the fragmentation damage rolls against, but it seems to work as intended, so I don't worry about it too much. Human-sized targets will be obliterated nearly instantly, while larger enemies (like hulks and such) can shrug them off more effectively and only take reduced damage. They seem to be great for dispatching bony enemies, which is exactly the use case I was thinking they should be useful for. Anything that survives will be stunned for a round or two.
  
  I also felt that explosive arrows were a bit lacking, so I added the WIDE and LARGE_BEANBAG tags to them. Essentially, this means that landing a direct hit with an explosive arrow will stun the target for a few turns, and it's easier to land explosive arrows on elusive targets. I figure since you're firing a big ol' tin can at something, it should be easier to get a more-or-less direct hit at medium-to-close range. The buff is most noticeable for bony targets and small monsters.
