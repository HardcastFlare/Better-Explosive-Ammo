# CDDA-Better-Explosive-Ammo
A small mod that makes explosive arrows a bit more useful and explosive slugs a LOT more useful.

  In the current experimental version (as of August 26, 2022), explosive slugs are crap, bordering on useless. This mod changes that. You can now smack down on just about anything with your rare explosive slugs. They can also penetrate doors now.
  
  I also felt that explosive arrows were a bit lacking, so I added the WIDE and LARGE_BEANBAG tags to them. Essentially, this means that landing a direct hit with an explosive arrow will stun the target for a few turns, and it's easier to land explosive arrows on elusive targets. I figure since you're firing a big ol' tin can at something, it should be easier to get a more-or-less direct hit at medium-to-close range. The buff is most noticeable for bony targets and small monsters.
